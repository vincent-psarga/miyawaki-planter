# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Tests redaction](./standards/tests-redaction.md) : Apply good practices for test redaction in **/*.spec.ts files using single expectations, assertive titles, and nested describe blocks for workflows to improve test clarity and maintainability during the development and testing of TypeScript applications.
- [Typescript code standards](./standards/typescript-code-standards.md) : Adopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with "I" and abstract classes with "Abstract" across all *.ts files to enhance code readability and maintain consistent naming conventions when developing and maintaining TypeScript applications.
